# zotero-plugin-index

A community index of plugins for Zotero 7 and later. The index lists plugins
and links to the releases of each author. It does not host plugin files, and
it does not review or endorse plugins.

## Plugin entries

Each plugin has one directory, `plugins/<id>/`, where `<id>` is the plugin id
from its manifest, for example `plugins/first-plugin@example.org/`. The
directory holds two files.

`meta.json` is an entry in the registry format. The registry is
[zotero-plugin-registry](https://github.com/zotero-plugin-dev/zotero-plugin-registry),
and its schema rejects fields that it does not define. Thus this file holds
only registry fields. Its `id` must equal the directory name.

`index.json` holds the data that only this index uses. It has these fields:

- `schemaVersion`: the version of the `index.json` schema. The current version
  is `1`. This field is required.
- `overrides`: a list of corrections to upstream facts. Use an override only
  when the plugin author cannot or will not fix the fact upstream. Each item
  has these fields:
  - `field`: the fact to correct. The value is one of `name`, `description`,
    `homepage`, `strict_min_version`, or `strict_max_version`.
  - `version`: the plugin version that the override applies to. If you leave
    it out, the override applies to every version.
  - `value`: the corrected value.
  - `reason`: why the upstream value is wrong. The reason must contain text
    other than whitespace.

The schema for `index.json` is
[`schemas/index.v1.schema.json`](schemas/index.v1.schema.json).

## Checking entries

The project uses Node 24 or later and pnpm. To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

To check every entry under `plugins/`, run:

```bash
pnpm check
```

The command prints one line for each problem, with the entry directory and
the rule that failed, then a summary line. If it finds a problem or cannot
load the registry schema, it exits with status 1. To check
the entries in another directory, give its path: `pnpm check <dir>`.

The first run downloads the registry schema into `.cache/`, so that run needs
a network connection. The command refuses a downloaded or cached schema whose
SHA-256 differs from the hash pinned in `src/check/registry-schema.ts`.

To run the tests, run:

```bash
pnpm test
```
